2) How can the distance to the precedence truck be guaranteed ?

The distance can be guaranteed via the LIDAR sensor in order to measure the car which has gone. If the truck has gone it will be detected by the sensor . The  LIDAR will send some signal to the previous truck and with the signal repelled . The information getted by the sensor will permit to know the distance.

 What happen in cases of a e.g. communication failure - > is your
system robust / still stable?

If the communication has failed , the system will locate via the gps localization of the primary truck . It permits to know in real time the localization of the truck.The LIDAR sensor will use the signal to see with the precedent truck .
